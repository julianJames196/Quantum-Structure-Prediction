Code repository for my Physics Part III project on: 'Structure Prediction with Quantum Computers'. Conducted with the help of Chris Pickard and Guglielmo Mazzolo of IBM. The aim of the project was to show  

# How to Install
The main file is the quant.py file which return the images and data I used in my viva. qasm_distribution is the main bit of quantum code in the file. 

# License and Author info
Code written by me with guidance from Guglielmo. All work in the repository is created by me.
